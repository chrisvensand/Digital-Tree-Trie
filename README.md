# Digital Tree Trie Implementation
This is my first attempt at implementing a digital tree also known as a trie. The program will create a trie from a list of words and output the shortest unique prefix to represent each word. 

Problem description:
> Find the shortest unique prefix to represent each word in a list. Assume that no word is prefix of another. In other words, the representation is always possible.


Example:
```
Input: [zebra, dog, duck, dove]
Output: {z, dog, du, dov}
where we can see that
zebra = z
dog = dog
duck = du
dove = dov
```
